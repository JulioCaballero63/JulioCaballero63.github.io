          The wide open spaces, rolling hills on the north bench, the beautiful
          Boise River valley, low crime and rural environment are just the
          beginning of what's attracting people to move to Middleton. With just
          a 30-40 minute commute on interstate I-80 to downtown Boise.
          Considering the median price for homes in Middleton less than Ada
          County to the east and is very close to the national average,
          affordable homes in Middleton are a main reason families decide to
          make the move. Middleton has great schools too, another feature that's
          convincing everyone to move to Middleton, Idaho.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Middleton was named for its location between the old fort Boise and
          Keeney's Ferry; it being the midpoint between the two. It served as a
          rest stop for those heading for Keeney's Ferry. It had a stage station
          in the early days of the Oregon Trail, a post office in 1866 and a
          water powered grist mill in 1871. The Ward Massacre occurred near the
          site in 1854. Middleton is the oldest settlement in Canyon County,
          with the land being parceled out in 1863 by William N. Montgomery. The
          Boise River flooded in 1872 and cut a new channel, isolating the town
          on an island; as a result, the town moved to a new location in the
          years after 1880. The town incorporated as a city in 1910, although
          the certificate was not issued until 1971. The present mayor is Steve
          Rule. On February 1, 2007, 78% of Middleton High School burned down,
          caused by the overheating of a fan above the weight room. The
          42-year-old building was built when fire codes required sprinklers to
          be installed, but there was no provision for their functionality. To
          save money during the construction of the school in the 1960s, the
          sprinklers were installed but were never connected to a water source.
