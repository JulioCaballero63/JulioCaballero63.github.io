      <h3>White Space</h3>
      <h4>Apple</h4>
      <a id="white-space-site" href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank"

        <b><i>White Space</i></b> is the area that separates elements in a
        webpage. White space does not necessarily have to be white, it can be
        any color, texture, pattern, or even a background image. White space
        sometime causes frustration between designers and clients. Design
        principles encourage the use of white space to help pages look better
        and allow for a better user experience. It is common for some clients to
        consider white space wasted space. They believe all that empty space
        should be used to display more information or other visual elements. But
        in reality, white space allows us to accomplish balance in our design
        elements, keep the content organized and have a better visual
        experience. People loose interest when all they see are line after line
        of information or a webpage crowded with pictures, it also makes it
        difficult to navigate. <b><i>Apple.com</i></b> is a good example of the
        white space design principle being used on a webpage design.

      <h3>Proximity</h3>
      <h4>Amazon</h4>
      <a id="proximity-site" href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"

      >

      <p>
        <b><i>Proximity</i></b> is the grouping of text or images in a way that
        it suggests that those items are related or not related to each other.
        We should visually group similar or related items together to emphasize
        their relationship. Also we should separate unrelated items to emphasize
        their lack of relationship. <b><i>Amazon.com</i></b> is a good example
        of the proximity principle, the web site groups related items and makes
        it easier to shop or compare items.

      <h3>Alignment</h3>
      <h4>Idaho Power</h4>
      <a id="alignment-site" href="https://www.idahopower.com/" target="_blank"
        >Idahopower.com</a
      >
      <img src="images/idahopower-min.jpg" alt="idaho power main page" />
      <p>
        <b><i>Alignment</i></b> is the principle that suggest that elements
        should be place in a certain way so that the elements are easier to
        read. Alignment is used to organize or group items, it is also used to
        create balance, structure, and connections between items.
        <b><i>Idaho Power</i></b
        >'s website is a good example of how we can use alignment to organize a
        web page. All of the text on the page is aligned to the left.
