        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Middleton was named for its location between the old fort Boise and
          Keeney's Ferry; it being the midpoint between the two. It served as a
          rest stop for those heading for Keeney's Ferry. It had a stage station
          in the early days of the Oregon Trail, a post office in 1866 and a
          water powered grist mill in 1871. The Ward Massacre occurred near the
          site in 1854. Middleton is the oldest settlement in Canyon County,
          with the land being parceled out in 1863 by William N. Montgomery. The
          Boise River flooded in 1872 and cut a new channel, isolating the town
          on an island; as a result, the town moved to a new location in the
          years after 1880. The town incorporated as a city in 1910, although
          the certificate was not issued until 1971. The present mayor is Steve
          Rule. On February 1, 2007, 78% of Middleton High School burned down,
          caused by the overheating of a fan above the weight room. The
          42-year-old building was built when fire codes required sprinklers to
          be installed, but there was no provision for their functionality. To
          save money during the construction of the school in the 1960s, the
          sprinklers were installed but were never connected to a water source.
